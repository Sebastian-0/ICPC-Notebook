# ICPC-Notebook
My notebook for programming competitions, originally made for the NWERC 2017 competition.

## How to build
1. Install LaTeX (and XeLaTeX)
2. Install pygments (`pip3 install pygments`)
3. Build using `build.sh`

If you want to build using an IDE you must add the `-shell-escape` flag to XeLaTeX when builing.
